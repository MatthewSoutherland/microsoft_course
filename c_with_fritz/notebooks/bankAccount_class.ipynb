    "A constructor is a special method in a class that gets called when you create a new instance of the class. Constructors are used to set up the initial state of an object or to perform any required initialization tasks. In C#, constructors have the same name as the class and don't have a return type.<br>\n",

    "- **Initialization**: Constructors are designed to set the initial state of an object, such as assigning default values to properties or setting up internal data structures.\n",

    "- **Overloading**: You can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameter lists. This is known as constructor overloading. When creating an instance of the class, the appropriate constructor is called based on the arguments passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Default constructor**: If you don't define any constructor in a class, the compiler automatically generates a default constructor with no parameters. The default constructor initializes all fields to their default values (e.g., null for reference types, 0 for numeric types, and false for the bool type).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: When you create an instance of a derived class, the constructor of the base class is called before the derived class's constructor. If you don't explicitly call a base class constructor, the default constructor (without parameters) will be called automatically. You can use the base keyword to call a specific base class constructor.\n"

They are used to encapsulate the internal state of an object and provide controlled access to its data.\n",
